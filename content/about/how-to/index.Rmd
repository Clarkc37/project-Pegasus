## How do I use this website?
Every day all the jumps races which are not maidens or bumpers are published on this site. Each course has it's own list of racecards with a variety of data available to you. They include the regular information which you find on most racecards such as the weight, age, form, trainer, jockey, official rating etc. but also includes a variety of other data which you may find useful.

There is the prediction score which is an output of the model which is not extremely important but can give an insight into how much better or worse a horse is compared to another.
Strike rates: the strike rates of the trainer and jockey for the past 21 days are depicted beneath their names and they are coloured to show how hot or cold they are.




```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
